	<p>Analysing the Gas Totals Graph</p>
</div>

<div class="para_text">
	<p>The Gas Totals graph is the second option in the tabs and can also be located by clicking
	<b>Graphs > Gas Totals</b></p>
</div>

<div class="para_text">
	<p>This graph allows the user to view their organisations gas usage in terms of kW hours. The same functionality for zooming (as shown in the Fig.29) can be applied to this graph. The gas totals graph is depicted in Fig.32 below.</p>

<div class="para_text">
	<p>	Underneath the Gas Totals graph are a selection of filters. These filters allow you to choose to see certain permutations of your energy usage. For example you may want to only view gas used in the <b>canteen</b> on the <b>second floor</b> in the <b>office block</b> of your facility in <b>England</b>. </p>
	<p>	The filters depicted below allow you to interrogate your data in this way. Hovering over the filters will open the options. This is seen in Fig.33 below.</p>

<div class="para_text">
	<p>These filters allow the user to view very specific information about their organisations gas usage and highlight areas of abnormality.</p>
	<p>There are 6 different types of filters</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li><b>Time Resolution:</b> This option allows you to filter the data on the graph by different frequency. You can choose, Half hourly, Daily, Weekly or Monthly. </li>
	<li><b>Filter By Meter:</b> This allows you to choose specific meters to filter by. The graph will then only display gas usage for the meters you have specified.</li>
		<li><b>Filter By Date:</b> This allows you to choose specific dates to filter by. For example you can choose to view gas usage for every tuesday of January for the year ending 2009.</li>
			<li><b>Filter by Date Span: </b> This allows you to choose a start and end date to filter by. The graph will then only display gas usage between the dates chosen.</li>
				<li><b>Filter By Time Span:</b> This allows you to choose a start and end time to filter by. The graph will then only display gas usage between the times chosen</li>
					<li><b>Filter By Country and Region: </b> This allows you to choose specific countries and regions to filter by. For example you may want to see your gas usage for all facilities in The East Midlands of the United Kingdom.</li>
</ul>

<div class = "para_text">
	<p>Once you have chosen any of the filters you must click the<b>Apply Filters</b> button on the bottom of the page. Once you have clicked this, the page will refresh and the gas usage graph will display only the gas usage that you have specified. </p>
	<p>Below the <b>Save</b> button you should also see the filters you have selected and the amount of data points the graph is depicting. Fig.34 below depicts an example of this</p>
</div>

	<img src="/helpdocs/images/filters_selected.png" width="500px" height="400px">
</div>

<div class="para_text">
	<p>As you can see from the above example the user wanted to view gas usage for all <b>half hourly meters</b> in <b>canteen B</b>, from the <b>1st of January 2010</b> til the <b>1st of January 2011</b> in the <b>canteen</b> of the <b>Office block</b> in <b>England</b>.</p>
	<p>The graph will then display <b>17,423</b> data points to depict the gas usage.</p>
	<p>If at any time the user wishes to clear the filters specified, click the <b>Reset Filters</b> button.</p>
